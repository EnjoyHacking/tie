Sample use
====== ===

   Here are some examples to show how to launch tie for different purposes.

   IMPORTANT: Some classifier plugins will disable themselves (lamenting
   "some requisites not satisfied") if needed options are not specified in
   command line: check in plugin specific documentation if this happens.

  Classification
  ==============

     * Capturing live traffic from a physical interface in realtime mode:

  tie -m r -i eth0

     * Reading traffic from a libpcap dump file in offline mode:

  tie -m o -r traffic.pcap

  Ground Truth Creation
  =====================

   To create a ground truth file based on deep packet inspection it is
   necessary to enable a payload based classification plugin (e.g.
   l7) editing bin/plugins/enabled_plugins file. Once enabled
   classification can be launched using the following options:

  tie -m o -r traffic.pcap -S 2048 -E traffic.gt

   where "-S" option specifies how many payload bytes to collect for each
   session and "-E" option specifies the ground truth file name.

   NOTE: if -S option is not specified the l7 plugin will disable
   itself because it can't obtain the features it needs

  Evaluation of Classification through pre-classified data (e.g. ground-truth)
  ============================================================================

   To evaluate a classification technique implemented by a plugin it is
   mandatory to have a pre-classification file, created before with some
   other techniques (see Ground Truth Creation). After that it is necessary
   to enable only the classification plugin to be tested (editing
   bin/plugins/enabled_plugins) and launch TIE with the following options:

  tie -m o -r traffic.pcap -E plugin_test.out

   When the execution is terminated, it is possible to show the resulting
   confusion matrix using the stats.pl script in the following manner:

  stats.pl plugin_test.out traffic.gt

  Training
  ========

   Some classification plugins could need a training phase. To train a
   classification plugin under TIE it is mandatory to have a ground truth
   file (see Ground Truth Creation). After that it is necessary to enable
   only the classification plugin to be trained (editing
   bin/plugins/enabled_plugins) and launch TIE with the following options:

  tie -m o -r training_trace.pcap -e output/training_trace.gt -l 20

   where the "-e" option specifies the ground truth file to use and the
   "-l" option enables training (disabling classification) with a threshold
   value to be used by the plugin to select sessions.
