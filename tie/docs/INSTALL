Installation
============

   TIE requires the libpcap library (downloadable at http://www.tcpdump.org). 
   After libpcap is installed, it is possible to build TIE.

   To build TIE:
   -------------

   $ tar zxvf tie_archive.tgz     # Extract sources from archive
   $ cd tie/src                   # Change to sources folder
   $ make                         # Build the whole application, WITH enabled plugins

   All the needed files will be put in "tie/bin"

   To install TIE into the system (root priviledges are needed):
   -------------------------------
   
   # make install

   By default this will put all files in "/opt/tie/" and will create symbolic links
   from "/usr/local/bin/" to the executables in "/opt/tie/".
   
   To show further building options:
   ---------------------------------

   $ make help


  Plugins
  =======

   Plugin source code must be placed in:

    src/plugins/<plugin-name>


   Selective building of plugins
   -----------------------------

   To enable plugin compilation from the main Makefile with the target
   plugins, add <plugin-name> to

    /src/plugins/enabled_plugins

   Comments are prefixed with a '#': to deactivate a plugin, simply comment
   out its name.


   Example
   -------

   To install "port" plugin you should extract its package this way:

   $ cd src/plugins
   $ tar xzvf <path_to_package>/class_port-1.0.tgz

   and then enable it by adding "port" to enabled_plugins:

   $ echo port >> enabled_plugins


   To build only plugins from TIE source dir:
   -----------------------------------------

   $ make plugins
