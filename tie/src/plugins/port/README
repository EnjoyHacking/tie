                              CLASS_PORT - TIE classification plug-in

1 Description

  This classifier uses as features source and destination port numbers for both TCP and UDP protocols.
  Most protocols use a well-known server port, thus most signatures rely only on destination 
  port. Moreover in some cases both port numbers are standard.
  
1.2 Signatures

  The plugin relies on signatures imported by the CoralReef suite from CAIDA [1]. In details they are stored
  into Application_ports_master.txt file. Refer to CoralReef documentation for more details [2].
  
1.3 Classification process

  The plugin loads the signatures from the aforementioned file and stores them into a hash table.
  When port ranges or more source-dest combinations are present into a signature, the parser creates
  an entry for each of them. This approach occupies some memory, but speeds up the classification
  process.    

  The classification process of a session is very simple. Three lookups into the hash table are performed
  considering different combinations:
   - protocol and both source and destination ports 
   - protocol and destination port only
   - protocol and source port only
  The lookup, if succesfull, will return the corresponding entry containing the application identifier.
